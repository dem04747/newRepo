## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r mtcars}
summary(mtcars)

```

## Including Plots



You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r }
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data=mtcars)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = mpg, y = wt))
```

Note that including  `echo = FALSE`  to the code chunk  '{r, echo =FALSE}' prevents printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
mpg

```
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data=mpg)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x =displ, y = hwy))
```
